\section{Introduction}
My name is Michael, a 21-year-old technology enthusiast with roots in Warsaw. I completed my secondary education with a VWO diploma in Milanówek, a place where the integration of technology in daily life sparked my curiosity and shaped my academic pursuits.
\medbreak
At the age of 14, my passion for technology manifested in a significant project — the creation of a robotic prosthetic limb for a teacher. This venture, which was brought to life by the time I was 16, involved the innovative use of Arduino, 3D printing, and open-source coding. It employed Electromyography (EMG) to interpret muscle movements, translating them into commands that enabled the prosthetic to move.
\medbreak

Following this success, I sought out internships that aligned with my interests, allowing me to delve deeper into 3D printing and data forensics. These experiences were invaluable, providing a practical foundation for my theoretical knowledge.
\medbreak

My academic journey continued at Fontys in Eindhoven, where I initially explored Mechatronics. However, my fascination with the intricate world of ICT and Software Engineering soon became apparent, prompting a shift in my focus. I find the complexities of ICT particularly compelling, as they offer endless possibilities for innovation and problem-solving.
\medbreak

Currently, in my quest for knowledge, I am keen to explore the convergence of coding with infrastructure. My objective is to expand my understanding of software systems and their underlying frameworks, while also enhancing my proficiency in hardware development.
\medbreak

In my personal time, I engage in designing PCBs and advancing my own tech-related projects. These activities not only fuel my creativity but also complement my academic and professional goals. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the evolution of gaming and enjoy exploring the historical context and development processes behind modern games. Culinary exploration is another pastime of mine, providing a delicious outlet for experimentation and discovery.

\section{Retrospect}
This couple of weeks were challenging, and my preformance wasn't the best as it could have been, but I still made progress, worked on my individual challenge, and worked with my group on our project, attends lectures and exercises to get most of it. I am aware I was behind schedule, but I am trying to catch up with everything, I lack right now.
\section{Conclusion}
My preformance have to improve but in my humble opinion I still made progress in KPI's I should have on the end of this semester
