\section{Introduction}
Hi, I'm Michael, I am 21 years old and am originally from Warsaw. My secondary education was
completed through community high school in my hometown, Milanówek, where I graduated with a VWO
(Świadectwo dojrzałosci) diploma. Two years ago I started my journey at Fontys and have been living in
Eindhoven for my studies. I have been fascinated by technology since a young age and how it was
integrated into everyday life in Warsaw. At 14 years old I found real-world applications for my interests
when I created a robotic prosthetic for one of my teachers. Using open-source code, an Arduino, and 3D
printing I was able to bring my design to life at 16. This prosthetic used Electromyography (EMG) to read
and translate the teacher's mussel movement into instructions for mechanical movement in the
prosthetic. After this, I took internships with a primary focus in 3D printing and data forensics. \par 
\medbreak
I started at Fontys ICT one year ago and just finished the 2nd semester of the ICT and Software Engineering
as my main profile route. Before ICT I attended the Fontys Mechatronics program and quickly realized
that I was more interested in ICT and its complexities. My technology knowledge helps me grow and
bring my ideas into the real world, and I enjoy integrating my knowledge of programming and 3D
printing with new software and hardware. I want to gather more knowledge about software and
infrastructure and expand my knowledge of hardware. My specific interests currently are in finding out
more about coding and connecting it to infrastructure. \par
\medbreak
In my spare time, I like to design PCBs, and work on my projects connected to them. Besides IT I like to
play games and explore their history how they were made and why as well as enjoy documentaries.
Often while I am watching films I find time to cook and experiment with new recipes.
